# Mini-Projects

I created this code showcase with the intention of demonstrating some code in action.

Here there are a series of self-contained functionalities, components or mini-applications, each fulfilling a specific purpose.

The idea was to demonstrate, in a mini-atmosphere, some solutions created in the applications I worked on.
